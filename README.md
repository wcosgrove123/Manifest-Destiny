# Manifest Destiny: The French and Indian War

Manifest Destiny: The French and Indian War is an immersive, historically grounded campaign designed in Foundry VTT v13+. Originally created to help high school U.S. history students understand the complexity and cause-and-effect of early American history, it now serves anyone seeking to simulate the French and Indian War era through collaborative role-play, strategic decision-making, and historical systems.

This project is part of a larger vision — a multi-era, interactive saga that spans U.S. history from 30,000 BCE to the present day.

## Purpose

This game began as a classroom tool to help students see how ordinary and extraordinary historical forces intersect. By stepping into the shoes of colonists, Indigenous leaders, government officials, or soldiers, players experience how small decisions ripple into major consequences — and how every faction in history has overlapping goals, pressures, and limits.

## Gameplay Overview

Gameplay Format:  
A hybrid mix of turn-based, real-time, and GM-led interaction. The long-term goal is to reduce GM intervention by building automated systems that allow history to unfold based on player decisions alone.

Playable Factions:

- Colonists: e.g., Boston Baker, Virginia Planter, Philadelphia Shipbuilder.  
  Build cities, farm, hunt, trade, and provide for the British Empire — until you no longer want to.

- Governments:  
  - British Parliament (Prime Minister, Treasurer, War Minister)  
  - French Court (Military & Resource officers)  
  - House of Burgesses (in progress)  
  Responsible for taxation, provisioning, and meeting empire needs. Fail to meet quotas? Lose the turn.

- Indigenous Nations:  
  - Cherokee, Shawnee, and Iroquois Confederacy  
  Navigate broken alliances, shifting power, and resistance. Send warriors where needed or negotiate survival.

- Military Commanders:  
  - Command the British Army, French Regulars, Native Warriors, or the Continental Army  
  - Each player leads one force through major historical battles with real troop movements and reinforcements.

## Current Features

- Scenes & Maps:
  - Fort Necessity, Monongahela, Ticonderoga, Louisbourg, Plains of Abraham, and more
  - Travelable cities: Philadelphia, Baltimore, Williamsburg, and the Western Frontier
- Tokens:
  - Colonial, military, and Indigenous characters, all scaled and styled for Foundry
- Items:
  - Historical weapons (muskets, tomahawks, cannons) and early economy resources (fur, bread, wood)
- Journals:
  - Early outlines of story arcs and faction goals
- Development in Progress:
  - Interactive macros for combat, trade, fatigue, and diplomacy
  - Historical map improvements with artist support
  - Turn-based scripting for automated event resolution

## Turn Structure

Each campaign turn simulates a specific timeframe in the French and Indian War:

- Turn 1 (1754): Fort Necessity & character exploration — no defined goals
- Turn 2 (1755–1756): Resource quotas, time-based production, military objectives
- Later Turns: Will include Lake George, Fort William Henry, Louisbourg, Ticonderoga, and the Fall of Quebec
